            Hello. If you're reading this, then, unfortunately, you've come across just a modified default Neocities webpage. This is something I'm actively working on (or not, if this website is unchanged for weeks) and there probably won't be much of anything here for quite a while. In the meantime, please occupy yourself with other pages on Neocities and see the other cool things people have created! Personally, i'd check out corru.observer if I were you. 
            
            See you around!
        </p>
        <p>To-do list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read through w3schools and watch some tutorials</li>
                <li>Look at making other webpages (i.e. Journal, About Me, Platforms...)</li>
                <li>Browse around for inspiration</li>
                <l1>Definitely look at getting some sort of style going for this website</l1>
            </ul>
